# nytx

My friends and I always race to see who can complete the New York Times Daily Mini the fastest -- but because the NYT only displays you and your friendsâ€™ results for the latest puzzle, there is no way to truly declare who the best puzzle solver is.

To solve this problem, I created [`nytx`](https://nytx.omikader.com), a serverless AWS application that aggregates my friends' Daily Mini results and computes our [TrueSkill](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/) rankings. Play with the API in your browser using the [_GraphQL Playground_](https://api.nytx.omikader.com).
